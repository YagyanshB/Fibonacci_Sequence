# Fibonacci Sequence Implementation

I have just started to build a crystal clear understanding of the way Google Colab & Python works.
This program is just built out of curiosity to develop on Python Coding.

# What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

A fibonacci sequence contains the next number being the sequence of the previous two numbers. However, in this sequence the first and second digit always remain 0 and 1. So the fibonnaci sequence will look like:

0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13.... and so on!
